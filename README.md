### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a 4th-year EECS student at UC Berkeley, seizing a place upon the exponential curve with gusto. Solid foundations in programming, applied mathematics, machine learning, and engineering. Pursuing roles where I can develop skills and industry knowledge for a career in AI R&D. Particular enthusiasm for Knowledge Engineering, NLP, Neuro-Symbolic/Semantic AI, Intelligent Systems.

- Breadth of real-world technical and interpersonal experience
- Proven competence in roles both team-oriented and autonomous, including those with ill-defined parameters for success. 
- Resilience working under pressure, adept at quickly grasping advanced concepts, and conversant with experts on high-level topics.

### Current work (2022-present): 

#### ML Research Assistant, UC Berkeley Center for Targeted Machine Learning

Ongoing collaboration with Professor Alejandro Schuler as the sole undergraduate member of his graduate research team, Real-World Methods. 
Research involves implementing, evaluation, and performance visualization of machine learning methods, including hyperparameter optimization, ensemble learning, feature engineering, and gradient boosting. 
Currently exploring methods to reduce computational complexity of Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) without compromising inference and convergence rate. 
Scikit-learn is my daily driver, but PyTorch and Hugging Face libraries are my next frontier.

### Skills & Knowledge Base

**Programming Languages:** Python, C++, Java, R, x86 Assembly

**Packages & libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, SpaCy, Matplotlib, Altair, Beautiful Soup, SQLite, some TensorFlow and PyTorch 

**Tools:** Version Control (Git/Github), VSCode, Intellij, Google Colab, Jupyter, pdb, API usage

**Other:** circuits, sensors, microcontrollers, signal processing, CAD, rapid prototyping, design

**Notable Projects:**

- Coded a neural network image classifier from scratch without high-level librariesâ€“only Python and Numpy (first foray into ML)
- Disaggregation of energy consumption data from single-point measurements via Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and random forests
- Designed and built wearable motion tracking devices for fitness application (think Guitar Hero, but for boxing)
- Implemented and compared PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) and Model-Predictive Control (MPC) systems in simulation environments
